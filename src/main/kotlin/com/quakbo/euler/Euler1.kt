If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

/*
Packages and imports work just like Java.

Directories do not have to match package names.  Source files can be placed arbitrarily in the file system.

Functions can be declared at the package level with no class associated with it.
    (1..999)                        Generates a Range containing the values [1, 999]

    .filter                         Produces a List containing only the values satisfying the given predicate

    { it % 3 == 0 || it % 5 == 0 }  A lambda expression.  Lambdas take the form { input -> expression }
                                    You can omit the input parameter and refer to the input with the special variable `it`

    .sum()                          Sum all of the values in the List and return the result

    println()                       Just like System.out.println() but far more powerful...
